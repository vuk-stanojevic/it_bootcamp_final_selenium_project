Hi! I'm Vuk Stanojevic and this is my final IT Bootcamp project. It was done on Java in IntelliJ IDEA, using Selenium 
WebDriver and TestNG.

The scope was to test some features and functionalities on the https://vue-demo.daniel-avellaneda.com/ page. All the
test cases, web elements and methods were done per the project documentation. Also, everything was numbered and 
named after the project documentation as well.

Due to some intentional quirks and specifics of the tested pages, some functions had to be automated via workarounds 
instead of more conventional solutions. All of those situations are noted in the code comments.

The @AfterMethod is a method that takes a screenshot of the page if a test fails and saves it in a local folder.

Although each test class can be run separately, I recommend running all of them by running the TestNG.xml
file as it's more convenient and classes are ordered to follow a logical flow.

I'm happy to receive any feedback, suggestions and proposals, so feel free to contact me by email at (vukstanojevic42[at]gmail[dot]com).
